# BCI-EMOTIV-EPOC-

Precise classification of a movement intentions recorded via EEG has long been a problem for the scientists focused on prosthetic control. Concerning the limitations of EEG recordings and data analysis the previous work could achieve on different tasks about 70% accuracy. Consequently, a more accurate algorithm for EEG classification of a simple, low-cost and mobile device Emotiv Epoc can be promising and applicable.
Here are Jupiter Notebook for imaginary motion classification on EEG raw data.
